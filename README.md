I've developed a script that serves as a foundational idea for an HTML code generator. At its current stage, it provides a basic framework for dynamically creating HTML elements based on user inputs, such as form fields, images, links, tables, lists, and iframes. This tool is designed to simplify the process of generating HTML code by allowing users to define elements and customize their attributes like font sizes, colors, and more.

The script begins with a simple user interface where users can select the type of HTML element they wish to create. It's important to note that this is still a work in progress, requiring further refinement and additional features to enhance usability and functionality. The interface dynamically updates based on the selected element, presenting specific options tailored to each type.

For instance, users can add form fields by specifying the field name and type (e.g., text, number) dynamically. They can also add images by providing a URL or uploading from their device, create hyperlinks with URL inputs, generate tables by specifying the number of rows and columns, create lists, and embed iframes for external content.

As I continue to develop this idea further, I aim to incorporate more advanced features, improve the user interface for better usability, and ensure compatibility across various devices and browsers. This script represents the initial steps towards a comprehensive HTML code generation tool that aims to streamline web development tasks effectively.
